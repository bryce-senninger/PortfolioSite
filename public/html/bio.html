            <p>I am a full-stack web developer specialized in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js,
                Express, MySQL, and MongoDB.</p>
            <p>Previous to coding, I was a student at the University of Utah. I entered the University of
                Utah with 60 credit hours applied to my degree from completion of the International
                Baccalaureate program and AP testing in high school, which unfortunately meant I didn't have
                much time to explore my interests in college. Rather quickly I found myself diving into
                upper level classes for my declared major, Economics with an Emphasis on Statistical
                Analysis. As I began to worry
                this field might not be my calling, I also found myself increasingly intrigued by the
                projects my friends
                in the CS department were working on.</p>
            <p>I decided to take a step away from the path in front of me and explore this curiousity in
                coding, and began tinkering around with HTML and CSS in the fall of 2018. Immediately I
                fell in love with the aspects of problem solving and implemenation of logic. Knowing that
                this was the path that I wanted to take, I decided to enroll in the Full-Stack Web
                Development Bootcamp offered through the University of Utah.</p>
            <p>The experience from the bootcamp was incredible, very rapidly exposing me to many different
                technologies and giving me the tools to take my code to the next level. Running through full
                front-end design, back-end database creation, and the necessary logic intersecting the two
                at a break-neck pace was a thrilling experience- and one that taught me quickly how
                important it is in the field of coding to be able to learn new concepts and adapt rapidly.
            </p>
            <p>I pride myself on my problem solving and learning capabilities, and having had them thorougly
                put to the test and discovering a passion in the process has been life-changing for me. I
                can't wait to see what the future holds for me in this exciting field.</p>
